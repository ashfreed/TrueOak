            <h1>What is a Corporate Authorised Representative?</h1>
            <p>A Corporate Authorised Representative (CAR) is a company that has been granted permission by an Australian Financial Services (AFS) Licensee, like True Oak Investments, to use its financial services authorisations to provide financial services to its clients.</p>
            <p>The CAR acts as an agent of the AFS Licensee and is authorised to provide specific financial services, as outlined in an agreement with the Licensee. These services generally include providing advice on, and dealing in (issuing or arranging) specific financial products.</p>
            <p>The AFS Licensee remains responsible for the actions of the CAR and its Sub-Authorised Representatives and must seek regular assurance from the CAR that it is acting compliantly in the interests of its clients.</p>

            <p>A Sub-Authorised Representative is an employee or contractor of a Corporate Authorised Representative (CAR) who is providing financial services under the terms of the CAR Agreement.</p>

            <h1>What are Trustee Services?</h1>
            <p>To operate a wholesale managed fund, you require a trustee. The role of the trustee is to be responsible for the compliance and governance of the fund, ensuring that it operates in accordance with its trust deed, disclosure documents and the law. The trustee has a duty to ensure that the fund is being managed in the best interests of all unitholders.</p>
            <p>A fund trustee is responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Issuing the fund’s offer document (Information Memorandum) and other fund communications.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Overseeing the fund manager, investment decisions and fund accounting.</li>
                <br>

                <h1>Is True Oak a Responsible Entity?</h1>
                <p>No, True Oak Investments is not a Responsible Entity (RE). The scope of our AFS Licence does not include an authorisation to operate a registered scheme. This means we’re unable to help you if you’re looking for a RE for your retail managed fund. </p>

            <div class="vertical-box">
                <h1>I need coverage under an AFSL whilst I apply for my own AFSL, can you help?</h1>
                <p>Yes, we’re comfortable welcoming CARs who need access to financial services authorisations whilst they apply for their own AFS Licence. Our CAR Agreements generally carry a minimum term of 12 months. If you terminate the Agreement inside the minimum term because you have obtained your own AFS Licence, you are required pay the Representative Fees payable for the remainder of the minimum term as a condition of leaving.</p>
