            <h1>Complaints Handling Policy</h1>
            <h3>Purpose of the Policy</h3>
            <p>True Oak Investments Ltd (True Oak, we, us, our) prides ourselves on the strong relationships we build with our clients.</p>
            <p>Client trust and satisfaction is important to us. As such, where you are unsatisfied with a service provided by True Oak, we have avenues available for you to submit your concerns. </p>
            <p>We treat all concerns and feedback received seriously and endeavour to address concerns promptly and fairly.</p>
            <h3>What is a Complaint?</h3>
            <p>A complaint is an expression of dissatisfaction made to or about an organisation, as it relates to its products, services, staff, or the handling of a concern, where a response or resolution is explicitly or implicitly expected and/or legally required.</p>
            <p>You may make a complaint in relation to a financial service provided under our Australian Financial Services (AFS) Licence.</p>
            <h3>How can you make a Complaint?</h3>
            <p>Complaints can be made via email to <a href="mailto:hello@trueoakinvestments.com.au">hello@trueoakinvestments.com.au</a></p>
            <p>Complaints can also be made by post to:</p>
            <br>True Oak Investments Ltd
            <br>C/O RSM
            <br>143 Bourke Street
            <br>Goulburn NSW 2580<p></p>
            <p>Please provide us with as much information as possible about your concern. This will help us to address and resolve it efficiently and effectively.</p>
            <p>We will work to accommodate different communication needs, such as a hearing impairment or linguistic diversity, to ensure that the feedback process is accessible to all. This can include working with a third party you have nominated to represent you, and/or arranging for an interpreter to help you make your complaint or arrange for any translation upon request and where appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
            <h3>What Happens after a Complaint is Lodged?</h3>
            <p>An acknowledgement will be issued to you within one business day of receipt of your complaint, by either return email or post. </p>
            <p>Our team will investigate and respond to all aspects of the matters raised in your complaint. We will provide you with a formal written response no later than 30 calendar days after receiving your complaint unless another timeframe is allowed or required under the relevant legislation. </p>
            <p>If you make a complaint and we resolve it within 5 business days from receipt to your satisfaction, we are not required to send you a formal complaint response unless you request one.  </p>
            <p>We will do our best to resolve your complaint as soon as possible. However, if we are unable to provide you with a response within the required timeframe, we will provide you with progress updates including reasons for the delay.  </p>
            <h3>Access to External Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>Dissatisfaction with our response, or the failure to receive a response within the required timeframe, may be reasons why your complaint can be referred to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA), an independent dispute resolution service established by the Government. </p>
            <p>If we have not had an opportunity to resolve your complaint first, AFCA may ask us to work with you to investigate and respond to your complaint before they commence their process.  </p>
            <p>AFCA's contact details are:</p>
            <br>Australian Financial Complaints Authority 
            <br>GPO Box 3 MELBOURNE VIC 3001

            <br>Email: info@afca.org.au
