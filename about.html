Your business becomes a Corporate Authorised Representative (CAR) of True Oak Investments, and under our Australian Financial Services (AFS) Licence, you are authorised to provide advice and dealing services to wholesale clients in relation to financial products including managed investment funds, securities, and carbon credits. Operating as a CAR means that you can focus on servicing your clients and building your brand, whilst we’re focused on the ongoing compliance activities related to holding a AFS Licence.

                    <h2>Trustee for Hire</h2>
                    <p>True Oak Investments is authorised by our Australian Financial Services (AFS) Licence to act as trustee to wholesale, unregistered managed investment funds across a spectrum of asset classes. As trustee, we’ll take responsibility for the compliance and governance of the fund, allowing you to focus on the fund’s growth and investment performance. Our bespoke approach allows us to deliver a solution that meets your needs. For example, we’re service provider agnostic, which means you select the providers (administrator, custodian, etc.) that meet your needs and your budget, and we’re always open to considering service enhancements and efficiencies. If you’re a fund manager seeking an appropriate structure to raise funds from wholesale investors, we’d welcome the opportunity to share our experience and expertise in providing independent trustee services with you.</p>
